    <p>The idea for this mission was ESA's Copernicus project, in 2015 two identical multispectral satellites were designed and launched in the 
        summer of that year on 23 June in French Guiana.
        <br />The purpose of this mission is to monitor changes in the Earth's surface conditions. The images are used to monitor soil, vegetation, 
        agriculture and forestry with the ultimate aim of protecting the world's environment. 
        The twin satellites are in geosynchronous orbit, at 
        786 kilometres, with a distance of 180 degrees between them, which allows for a combined five-day visit to the equator.
        <br />Due to the mission requirement for high geometric and spectral efficiency of large area measurements, a multispectral instrument 
        (MSI) design was chosen on the two Sentinel-2s.
